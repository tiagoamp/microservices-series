# microservices-series

This is the source code of the microservices developed to demonstrate the concepts of this kind of architecture in my blog posts at Medium.
Each branch contains the source code of each part(chapter) of the articles.

- [Part I: Project setup, REST communication and Service Discovery](https://tiagoamp.medium.com/microservices-with-java-part-1-f5fe79bf43aa) - branch ch-01
- [Part II: Fault tolerance and Configuration Server](https://tiagoamp.medium.com/microservices-with-java-part-2-b77cc37943e2) - branch ch-02
- [Part III: API Gateway and Centralized logs](https://tiagoamp.medium.com/microservices-with-java-part-3-10428edc1082) - branch ch-03
- Part IV: Authentication and Authorization (yet to be done, itâ€™s on my TODO list.. :-P)

This main branch contains the final implementation of the microservices.
